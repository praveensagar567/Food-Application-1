By the year 2071, humanity has expanded across the galaxy, filling the surface of other planets with settlements like those on Earth. These new societies are plagued by murder, drug use, and theft, and intergalactic outlaws are hunted by a growing number of tough bounty hunters.\n\nSpike Spiegel and Jet Black pursue criminals throughout space to make a humble living. Beneath his goofy and aloof demeanor, Spike is haunted by the weight of his violent past. Meanwhile, Jet manages his own troubled memories while taking care of Spike and the Bebop, their ship. The duo is joined by the beautiful con artist Faye Valentine, odd child Edward Wong Hau Pepelu Tivrusky IV, and Ein, a bioengineered Welsh Corgi.\n\nWhile developing bonds and working to catch a colorful cast of criminals, the Bebop crew's lives are disrupted by a menace from Spike's past. As a rival's maniacal plot continues to unravel, Spike must choose between life with his newfound family or revenge for his old wounds.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"When Cowboy Bebop first aired in spring of 1998 on TV Tokyo, only episodes 2, 3, 7-15, and 18 were broadcast, it was concluded with a recap special known as Yose Atsume Blues. This was due to anime censorship having increased following the big controversies over Evangelion, as a result most of the series was pulled from the air due to violent content. Satellite channel WOWOW picked up the series in the fall of that year and aired it in its entirety uncensored. Cowboy Bebop was not a ratings hit in Japan, but sold over 19,000 DVD units in the initial release run, and 81,000 overall. Protagonist Spike Spiegel won Best Male Character, and Megumi Hayashibara won Best Voice Actor for her role as Faye Valentine in the 1999 and 2000 Anime Grand Prix, respectively. Cowboy Bebop's biggest influence has been in the United States, where it premiered on Adult Swim in 2001 with many reruns since. The show's heavy Western influence struck a chord with American viewers, where it became a \"gateway drug\" to anime aimed at adult audiences.","season":"spring","year":1998,"broadcast":{"day":"Saturdays","time":"01:00","timezone":"Asia\/Tokyo","string":"Saturdays at 01:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"Bandai Visual","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/23\/Bandai_Visual"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/102\/Funimation"},{"mal_id":233,"type":"anime","name":"Bandai Entertainment","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/233\/Bandai_Entertainment"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":14,"type":"anime","name":"Sunrise","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/14\/Sunrise"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/1\/Action"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/24\/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":50,"type":"anime","name":"Adult Cast","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/50\/Adult_Cast"},{"mal_id":29,"type":"anime","name":"Space","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/29\/Space"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":5,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/5\/Cowboy_Bebop__Tengoku_no_Tobira","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1439\/93480.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1439\/93480t.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1439\/93480l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1439\/93480.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1439\/93480t.webp","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1439\/93480l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"hc7IxJ93jtM","url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=hc7IxJ93jtM","embed_url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/hc7IxJ93jtM?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/hc7IxJ93jtM\/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/hc7IxJ93jtM\/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/hc7IxJ93jtM\/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/hc7IxJ93jtM\/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/hc7IxJ93jtM\/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Cowboy Bebop: Tengoku no Tobira"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Cowboy Bebop: Knockin' on Heaven's Door"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"\u30ab\u30a6\u30dc\u30fc\u30a4\u30d3\u30d0\u30c3\u30d7 \u5929\u56fd\u306e\u6249"},{"type":"English","title":"Cowboy Bebop: The Movie"},{"type":"German","title":"Cowboy Bebop: Der Film"},{"type":"Spanish","title":"Cowboy Bebop: La Pel\u00edcula"},{"type":"French","title":"Cowboy Bebop: Le Film"}],"title":"Cowboy Bebop: Tengoku no Tobira","title_english":"Cowboy Bebop: The Movie","title_japanese":"\u30ab\u30a6\u30dc\u30fc\u30a4\u30d3\u30d0\u30c3\u30d7 \u5929\u56fd\u306e\u6249","title_synonyms":["Cowboy Bebop: Knockin' on Heaven's Door"],"type":"Movie","source":"Original","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2001-09-01T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":1,"month":9,"year":2001},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Sep 1, 2001"},"duration":"1 hr 55 min","rating":"R - 17+ (violence & profanity)","score":8.38,"scored_by":200294,"rank":183,"popularity":590,"members":349533,"favorites":1383,"synopsis":"Another day, another bounty\u2014such is the life of the often unlucky crew of the Bebop.

The initial Geneon Entertainment USA (then known as Pioneer) releases on VHS and DVD (singles, Signature Series, and box set) used only the first opening on each episode. This was due to the Japanese licensor providing them clean materials for only the first opening to put the English credits on. Geneon later fixed this mistake on their Limited Edition tin releases in 2005\/2006, as well as on the Remix singles. Following Geneon USA's demise in late 2007, the show went out of print. When FUNimation Entertainment picked up the show in 2010 and released it, they repeated Geneon's mistake of using only the first opening on every episode. This mistake was later fixed in 2013 on the Anime Classics re-release.","season":"spring","year":1998,"broadcast":{"day":"Thursdays","time":"01:15","timezone":"Asia\/Tokyo","string":"Thursdays at 01:15 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":123,"type":"anime","name":"Victor Entertainment","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/123\/Victor_Entertainment"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/102\/Funimation"},{"mal_id":1459,"type":"anime","name":"Geneon Entertainment USA","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1459\/Geneon_Entertainment_USA"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":11,"type":"anime","name":"Madhouse","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/11\/Madhouse"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/1\/Action"},{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/2\/Adventure"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/24\/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":50,"type":"anime","name":"Adult Cast","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/50\/Adult_Cast"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/27\/Shounen"}]},{"mal_id":7,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/7\/Witch_Hunter_Robin","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/10\/19969.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/10\/19969t.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/10\/19969l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/10\/19969.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/10\/19969t.webp","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/10\/19969l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"7UkaILjPk8M","url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=7UkaILjPk8M","embed_url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/7UkaILjPk8M?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/7UkaILjPk8M\/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/7UkaILjPk8M\/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/7UkaILjPk8M\/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/7UkaILjPk8M\/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/7UkaILjPk8M\/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Witch Hunter Robin"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"WHR"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"Witch Hunter ROBIN (\u30a6\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u30cf\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30ed\u30d3\u30f3)"},{"type":"English","title":"Witch Hunter Robin"}],"title":"Witch Hunter Robin","title_english":"Witch Hunter Robin","title_japanese":"Witch Hunter ROBIN (\u30a6\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1\u30cf\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30ed\u30d3\u30f3)","title_synonyms":["WHR"],"type":"TV","source":"Original","episodes":26,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2002-07-03T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2002-12-25T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":3,"month":7,"year":2002},"to":{"day":25,"month":12,"year":2002}},"string":"Jul 3, 2002 to Dec 25, 2002"},"duration":"25 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":7.25,"scored_by":42221,"rank":2800,"popularity":1745,"members":109185,"favorites":592,"synopsis":"Robin Sena is a powerful craft user drafted into the STNJ\u2014a group of specialized hunters that fight deadly beings known as Witches.

Mankind is unable to defend themselves against the Angels despite utilizing their most advanced munitions and military tactics. The only hope for human salvation rests in the hands of NERV, a mysterious organization led by the cold Gendou Ikari. NERV operates giant humanoid robots dubbed \"Evangelions\" to combat the Angels with state-of-the-art advanced weaponry and protective barriers known as Absolute Terror Fields.\n\nYears after being abandoned by his father, Shinji Ikari, Gendou's 14-year-old son, returns to Tokyo-3. Shinji undergoes a perpetual internal battle against the deeply buried trauma caused by the loss of his mother and the emotional neglect he suffered at the hands of his father. Terrified to open himself up to another, Shinji's life is forever changed upon meeting 29-year-old Misato Katsuragi, a high-ranking NERV officer who shows him a free-spirited maternal kindness he has never experienced.\n\nA devastating Angel attack forces Shinji into action as Gendou reveals his true motive for inviting his son back to Tokyo-3: Shinji is the only child capable of efficiently piloting Evangelion Unit-01, a new robot that synchronizes with his biometrics. Despite the brutal psychological trauma brought about by piloting an Evangelion, Shinji defends Tokyo-3 against the angelic threat, oblivious to his father's dark machinations.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Director Hideaki Anno's depression is what led to the dark themes of Neon Genesis Evangelion. Budgetary problems and parental complaints about content led to the original ending being scrapped and replaced with an extremely limited-animation ending breaking from the main plot. A movie, End of Evangelion, was later made based in part on the original planned ending and in part on Anno's increasing frustration with the otaku fanbase. The series' mix of psychoanalysis, religious symbolism, and genre deconstruction proved extremely influential on mature anime in the late '90s onward. The Japan Media Arts Festival in 2006 ranked it as the most popular anime of all time.","season":"fall","year":1995,"broadcast":{"day":"Wednesdays","time":"18:30","timezone":"Asia\/Tokyo","string":"Wednesdays at 18:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":16,"type":"anime","name":"TV Tokyo","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/16\/TV_Tokyo"},{"mal_id":113,"type":"anime","name":"Kadokawa Shoten","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/113\/Kadokawa_Shoten"},{"mal_id":139,"type":"anime","name":"Nihon Ad Systems","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/139\/Nihon_Ad_Systems"},{"mal_id":1461,"type":"anime","name":"Audio Tanaka","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1461\/Audio_Tanaka"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":97,"type":"anime","name":"ADV Films","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/97\/ADV_Films"},{"mal_id":783,"type":"anime","name":"GKIDS","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/783\/GKIDS"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":6,"type":"anime","name":"Gainax","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/6\/Gainax"},{"mal_id":103,"type":"anime","name":"Tatsunoko Production","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/103\/Tatsunoko_Production"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/1\/Action"},{"mal_id":5,"type":"anime","name":"Avant Garde","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/5\/Avant_Garde"},{"mal_id":46,"type":"anime","name":"Award Winning","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/46\/Award_Winning"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/8\/Drama"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/24\/Sci-Fi"},{"mal_id":41,"type":"anime","name":"Suspense","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/41\/Suspense"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Mecha","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/18\/Mecha"},{"mal_id":40,"type":"anime","name":"Psychological","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/40\/Psychological"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":31,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/31\/Neon_Genesis_Evangelion__Death___Rebirth","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1993\/113122.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1993\/113122t.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1993\/113122l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1993\/113122.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1993\/113122t.webp","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1993\/113122l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"eI8aUqsCovo","url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=eI8aUqsCovo","embed_url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/eI8aUqsCovo?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/eI8aUqsCovo\/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/eI8aUqsCovo\/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/eI8aUqsCovo\/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/eI8aUqsCovo\/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/eI8aUqsCovo\/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"approved":true,"titles":[{"type":"Default","title":"Neon Genesis Evangelion: Death & Rebirth"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Shinseiki Evangelion Gekijouban: Shi to Shinsei"},{"type":"Synonym","title":"Neon Genesis Evangelion - Death and Rebirth"},{"type":"Japanese","title":"\u0090\u65b0\u4e16\u7d00\u30a8\u30f4\u30a1\u30f3\u30b2\u30ea\u30aa\u30f3\u5287\u5834\u7248 \u30b7\u30c8\u65b0\u751f"},{"type":"English","title":"Neon Genesis Evangelion: Death & Rebirth"}],"title":"Neon Genesis Evangelion: Death & Rebirth","title_english":"Neon Genesis Evangelion: Death & Rebirth","title_japanese":"\u0090\u65b0\u4e16\u7d00\u30a8\u30f4\u30a1\u30f3\u30b2\u30ea\u30aa\u30f3\u5287\u5834\u7248 \u30b7\u30c8\u65b0\u751f","title_synonyms":["Shinseiki Evangelion Gekijouban: Shi to Shinsei","Neon Genesis Evangelion - Death and Rebirth"],"type":"Movie","source":"Original","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1997-03-15T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":15,"month":3,"year":1997},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Mar 15, 1997"},"duration":"1 hr 44 min","rating":"R - 17+ (violence & profanity)","score":7.46,"scored_by":135677,"rank":1834,"popularity":874,"members":243177,"favorites":654,"synopsis":"In the year 2015, more than a decade has passed since the catastrophic event known as Second Impact befell mankind.

Due to great improvements in cybernetics, its citizens are able to replace their limbs with robotic parts. The world is now more interconnected than ever before, and the city's Public Security Section 9 is responsible for combating corruption, terrorism, and other dangerous threats following this shift toward globalization.\n\nThe strong-willed Major Motoko Kusanagi of Section 9 spearheads a case involving a mysterious hacker known only as the \"Puppet Master,\" who leaves a trail of victims stripped of their memories. Like many in this futuristic world, the Puppet Master's body is almost entirely robotic, giving them incredible power.\n\nAs Motoko and her subordinates follow the enigmatic criminal's trail, other parties\u2014including Section 6\u2014start to get involved, forcing her to confront the extremely complicated nature of the case. Pondering about various philosophical questions, such as her own life's meaning, Motoko soon realizes that the one who will provide these answers is none other than the Puppet Master themself.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Mamoru Oshii's Ghost in the Shell was the first film to adapt Masamune Shirow's manga of the same name. It heavily condenses the original storyline, reducing the original material's comic relief and sexual content in favor of a more serious tone and changing the setting from Japan to a city modelled after Hong Kong. The artwork within the animated film was produced using an innovative mix of cel animation and digital effects. Ghost in the Shell is one of the world's most famous Japanese animated films, being the first to reach #1 on Billboard magazine's video best-seller list, and also served as a major inspiration for the Wachowskis in their creation of the Matrix movies. A special edition titled Ghost in the Shell: 2.0 was released in 2008, which features scenes reanimated with additional CGI to match the style of the 2004's sequel, Ghost in the Shell: Innocence.","season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"Bandai Visual","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/23\/Bandai_Visual"},{"mal_id":159,"type":"anime","name":"Kodansha","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/159\/Kodansha"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":947,"type":"anime","name":"Manga Entertainment","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/947\/Manga_Entertainment"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":10,"type":"anime","name":"Production I.G","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/10\/Production_IG"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/1\/Action"},{"mal_id":7,"type":"anime","name":"Mystery","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/7\/Mystery"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/24\/Sci-Fi"},{"mal_id":41,"type":"anime","name":"Suspense","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/41\/Suspense"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":50,"type":"anime","name":"Adult Cast","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/50\/Adult_Cast"},{"mal_id":39,"type":"anime","name":"Detective","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/39\/Detective"},{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Mecha","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/18\/Mecha"},{"mal_id":40,"type":"anime","name":"Psychological","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/40\/Psychological"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":42,"type":"anime","name":"Seinen","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/42\/Seinen"}]}],"links":{"first":"http:\/\/api.jikan.moe\/v4\/anime?=1","last":"http:\/\/api.jikan.moe\/v4\/anime?=968","prev":null,"next":"http:\/\/api.jikan.moe\/v4\/anime?=2"},"meta":{"current_page":1,"from":1,"last_page":968,"links":[{"url":null,"label":"pagination.previous","active":false},{"url":"http:\/\/api.jikan.moe\/v4\/anime?=1","label":"1","active":true},{"url":"http:\/\/api.jikan.moe\/v4\/anime?=2","label":"2","active":false},{"url":"http:\/\/api.jikan.moe\/v4\/anime?=3","label":"3","active":false},{"url":"http:\/\/api.jikan.moe\/v4\/anime?=4","label":"4","active":false},{"url":"http:\/\/api.jikan.moe\/v4\/anime?=5","label":"5","active":false},{"url":"http:\/\/api.jikan.moe\/v4\/anime?=6","label":"6","active":false},{"url":"http:\/\/api.jikan.moe\/v4\/anime?=7","label":"7","active":false},{"url":"http:\/\/api.jikan.moe\/v4\/anime?=8","label":"8","active":false},{"url":"http:\/\/api.jikan.moe\/v4\/anime?=9","label":"9","active":false},{"url":"http:\/\/api.jikan.moe\/v4\/anime?=10","label":"10","active":false},{"url":null,"label":"...","active":false},{"url":"http:\/\/api.jikan.moe\/v4\/anime?=967","label":"967","active":false},{"url":"http:\/\/api.jikan.moe\/v4\/anime?=968","label":"968","active":false},{"url":"http:\/\/api.jikan.moe\/v4\/anime?=2","label":"pagination.next","active":false}],"path":"http:\/\/api.jikan.moe\/v4\/anime","per_page":25,"to":25,"total":24190}}
